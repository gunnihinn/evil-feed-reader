== Plan

The configuration doesn't change very often. Keep it in some basic set of objects:

    type Feed struct{ // things }

We can enrich (a copy of) that object with raw feed data, which will come from
HTTP calls in our case.

We can parse that data into a Feed with Entries.

This is a scatter/gather operation.

= Evil feed reader

I'm frustrated with the RSS and atom readers available, and decided to
write my own that does what I want, silly name and all.

Note that what I personally want may not at all be what you want.

== Features

Very few!

You define the feeds you want to follow in a JSON config file. The format the
program understand is:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "url": "feed URL",
        "nickname": "optional nickname for feed",
        "prefix": "optional prefix for feed link URLs"
    }
]
----

Every entry needs a `url` value. Use `nickname` to pick names for feed titles
you think are better than what its authors chose. Use `prefix` if a feed only
provides relative links to its items and you know what to prefix them with to
make working links.

Evil feed reader keeps no state. We currently render feeds in the browser,
which is perfectly capable of remembering what links we've already visited, and
thus what items we've already read.

== To run

You need a Go compiler; any one should do. The project dependencies are
vendored with `dep`. Compile and run the reader with:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gunnihinn/evil-feed-reader.git
    $ make      # needs GNU make
    $ ./evil-feed-reader

This will launch an HTTP server on `localhost:8080` that renders the latest
items from the feeds you are interested in.

You'll need to setup some feed URLs for the reader to do anything. The reader
will look for a file named `feeds.json` in the directory where it is run by
default. You can have it look elsewhere by passing a `-feeds` flag to it when
run.

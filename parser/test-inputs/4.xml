			<![CDATA[<p>For once, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-wiretap-hack/">real story</a> isn't as bad as it seems. A researcher has figured out how to install malware onto an Echo that causes it to stream audio back to a remote controller, but:</p>

<blockquote><p>The technique requires gaining physical access to the target Echo, and it works only on devices sold before 2017. But there's no software fix for older units, Barnes warns, and the attack can be performed without leaving any sign of hardware intrusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>The way to implement this attack is by intercepting the Echo before it arrives at the target location. But if you can do that, there are a lot of other things you can do. So while this is a vulnerability that needs to be fixed -- and seems to have inadvertently been fixed -- it's not a cause for alarm.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>Richard Ledgett -- a former Deputy Director of the NSA -- <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/no-us-government-should-not-disclose-all-vulnerabilities-its-possession">argues</a> against the US government disclosing all vulnerabilities:</p>

<blockquote><p>Proponents argue that this would allow patches to be developed, which in turn would help ensure that networks are secure. On its face, this argument might seem to make sense -- but it is a gross oversimplification of the problem, one that not only would not have the desired effect but that also would be dangerous.</p></blockquote>

<p>Actually, he doesn't make that argument at all. He basically says that security is a lot more complicated than finding and disclosing vulnerabilities -- something I don't think anyone disagrees with. His conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Malicious software like WannaCry and Petya is a scourge in our digital lives, and we need to take concerted action to protect ourselves. That action must be grounded in an accurate understanding of how the vulnerability ecosystem works. Software vendors need to continue working to build better software and to provide patching support for software deployed in critical infrastructure. Customers need to budget and plan for upgrades as part of the going-in cost of IT, or for compensatory measures when upgrades are impossible. Those who discover vulnerabilities need to responsibly disclose them or, if they are retained for national security purposes, adequately safeguard them. And the partnership of intelligence, law enforcement and industry needs to work together to identify and disrupt actors who use these vulnerabilities for their criminal and destructive ends. No single set of actions will solve the problem; we must work together to protect ourselves. As for blame, we should place it where it really lies: on the criminals who intentionally and maliciously assembled this destructive ransomware and released it on the world. </p></blockquote>

<p>I don't think anyone would argue with any of that, either. The question is whether the US government should prioritize attack over defense, and security over surveillance. Disclosing, especially in a world where the secrecy of zero-day vulnerabilities is so fragile, greatly improves the security of our critical systems.</p>]]>

    <title>Uber Drivers Hacking the System to Cause Surge Pricing</title>

<blockquote><p>According to the study. drivers manipulate Uber's algorithm by logging out of the app at the same time, making it think that there is a shortage of cars.

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The study said drivers have been coordinating forced surge pricing, after interviews with drivers in London and New York, and research on online forums such as Uberpeople.net. In a post on the website for drivers, seen by the researchers, one person said: "Guys, stay logged off until surge. Less supply high demand = surge."</p></blockquote>.</p>

<p>Passengers, of course, have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/uber/11964956/Can-Ubers-surge-pricing-be-gamed.html">long had tricks</a> to avoid surge pricing.</p>

<p>I expect to see more of this sort of thing as algorithms become more prominent in our lives.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meet-alex-the-russian-casino-hacker-who-makes-millions-targeting-slot-machines/">story</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The venture is built on Alex's talent for reverse engineering the algorithms -- known as pseudorandom number generators, or PRNGs -- that govern how slot machine games behave. Armed with this knowledge, he can predict when certain games are likeliest to spit out moneyÂ­insight that he shares with a legion of field agents who do the organization's grunt work.

<p>These agents roam casinos from Poland to Macau to Peru in search of slots whose PRNGs have been deciphered by Alex. They use phones to record video of a vulnerable machine in action, then transmit the footage to an office in St. Petersburg. There, Alex and his assistants analyze the video to determine when the games' odds will briefly tilt against the house. They then send timing data to a custom app on an agent's phone; this data causes the phones to vibrate a split second before the agent should press the "Spin" button. By using these cues to beat slots in multiple casinos, a four-person team can <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/russians-engineer-brilliant-slot-machine-cheat-casinos-no-fix/">earn more than $250,000 a week</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's an interesting article; I have no idea how much of it is true.</p>

<p>The sad part is that the slot-machine vulnerability is so easy to fix. Although the article says that "writing such algorithms requires tremendous mathematical skill," it's really only true that designing the algorithms requires that skill. Using any of secure encryption algorithm or hash function as a PRNG is trivially easy. And there's no reason why the system can't be designed with a real RNG. There is some randomness in the system somewhere, and it can be added into the mix as well. The programmers can use a well-designed algorithm, like my own <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/fortuna/">Fortuna</a>, but even something less well-thought-out is likely to foil this attack.</p>]]>

<blockquote><p>One example of the sheer creativity with which the TAO spies approach their work can be seen in a hacking method they use that exploits the error-proneness of Microsoft's Windows. Every user of the operating system is familiar with the annoying window that occasionally pops up on screen when an internal problem is detected, an automatic message that prompts the user to report the bug to the manufacturer and to restart the program. These crash reports offer TAO specialists a welcome opportunity to spy on computers.

<p>When TAO selects a computer somewhere in the world as a target and enters its unique identifiers (an IP address, for example) into the corresponding database, intelligence agents are then automatically notified any time the operating system of that computer crashes and its user receives the prompt to report the problem to Microsoft. An internal presentation suggests it is NSA's powerful <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/germany-is-a-both-a-partner-to-and-a-target-of-nsa-surveillance-a-916029.html">XKeyscore</a> spying tool that is used to fish these crash reports out of the massive sea of Internet traffic.</p>

<p>The automated crash reports are a "neat way" to gain "passive access" to a machine, the presentation continues. Passive access means that, initially, only data the computer sends out into the Internet is captured and saved, but the computer itself is not yet manipulated. Still, even this passive access to error messages provides valuable insights into problems with a targeted person's computer and, thus, information on security holes that might be exploitable for planting malware or spyware on the unwitting victim's computer.</p>

<p>Although the method appears to have little importance in practical terms, the NSA's agents still seem to enjoy it because it allows them to have a bit of a laugh at the expense of the Seattle-based software giant. In one internal graphic, they replaced the text of Microsoft's original error message with one of their own reading, "This information may be intercepted by a foreign sigint system to gather detailed information and better exploit your machine." ("Sigint" stands for "signals intelligence.")</p></blockquote>

<p>The article talks about the (limited) value of this information with regard to specific target computers, but I have another question: how valuable would this database be for finding new zero-day Windows vulnerabilities to exploit? Microsoft won't have the incentive to examine and fix problems until they happen broadly among its user base. The NSA has a completely different incentive structure.</p>

<p>I don't remember this being discussed back in 2013.</p>

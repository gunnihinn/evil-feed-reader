	Well, that old novel of mine is about to come out and bring peace on Earth, so, as is officially required of anybody who writes anything longer than 50,000 words and receives at least two pieces of hate mail, it is time to impart my hard-won lessons upon the masses. As usual, my insights will ...</description>

	(Best if read as Verner Herzog or Christopher Walken. I can't decide.)
	
	The furtive licking belies the intensity of his desire; the need to merge with water made crass by honest thirst. To fully reveal the moment, we use slow motion.
	As time expands, the tongue ceases to be a blurred, simple ...</description>

	I don't get jet lag. I just don't. I never have, and after flying through two sunrises, three meals, two glasses of wine, and three airports on three islands over 30 hours from Osaka to JFK with no ill effects, I'm pretty sure I never will.

		<description>	
	Nothing. You're fucked.
	It's a nukular sharknado. It doesn't listen to reason: It's an unreasonable thing. It can't spell, and it's a radioactive tornado made of sharks. Or possibly a tornado made out of radioactive sharks. It doesn't matter; if you have to shout, "Look out for the nukular sharknado," ...</description>

	Because the social struggle for understanding and inclusiveness is inherently pacifistic, its adherents have little outlet for the goblins of their personalities. Luckily, we have self-righteousness and passive aggression to fill the void, and if nobody of an alternate political persuasion will ...</description>

	I get about two recruiter emails a week, because I work in a bubble industry that's getting fattened up for the inevitable slaughter. Once, they made me feel desired and capable. Then they were junk mail. Then they started finding my personal email addresses and they became obnoxious. I must a be ...</description>

	I had a conversation with an Aeon article a few weeks ago. It didn't go well. I will relate as best I can:


	[The brain] does not contain most of the things people think it does&#8212;not even simple things such as memories.


	Well that's a bold statement and I will continue reading.

	Boilerplate

	I've been lumped in the Social Justice Warrior category a few times, and I don't mind it because the lumping lumps are usually Men's Rights Activists, and they are terrible nonsense people, so I can assume I won't mind being anything they accuse me of being. But all such general-purpose ...</description>

	The snow's been falling hard for twelve hours, and I haven't taken off my pajamas for any of them. For the six of them that I've been conscious, I've watched three episodes of X-Files, two of Archer, and three of Rick and Morty. I have not played a game. I'm saving myself.

	I just came across another manifestation of imposter syndrome, in the form of "Am I really a developer or just a good googler?"
	The answer I read missed the point, so I'm going to break this mess down, because too many people are afraid for no good reason.

I, meanwhile, was carrying an armful of books and a conspicuously ...</description>

	13.something billion years ago, something weird happened. In the next few very small increments of time something fieldy doubled in size. Then it did the same thing about 80 times, which may not instantly seem like a lot, but it's too big a factor of change even to fit on one ...</description>
